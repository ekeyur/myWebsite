<p id="Intro"> I like to go hiking trips. Usually make it to Stone Mountain every other week. I also like to go Kayaking. Not into drinking or party scene anymore. I also like to explore new things. I am also into technology and keep up with the startup scene. Or atleast, I would like to think so.</p>
